# Chapter 3 — Feature 001: the validation harness + batched core (2026-06-21)

Adopted GitHub Spec Kit (`be5aea9`) and folded harness + real core + batching
into one feature. Built the `pra` package: the batched, `dim`-grouped
FrameGroup kernel (PRA-01 §7.2's hard requirement), five swappable seams (Bus,
Scorer, ProposalPolicy, DecayPolicy, EventSource), deterministic telemetry, and
the `pra-validate` CLI (suite / determinism / scale). The new core reproduced
the v4 oracle's trajectory **near bit-for-bit at ~40× the speed**, byte-identical
on re-run. T1–T6 all PASS at the reference (T4 within-one majority at every
checkpoint: 8/8, 8/8, 6/8). T-SCALE became runnable — and reported `best_dim≈1`
at `true_dim ∈ {20,35,50}`: the scale question was formally open. Commits
`7387bd7` → `d17354c`.
