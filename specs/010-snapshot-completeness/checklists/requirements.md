# Specification Quality Checklist: Snapshot Completeness

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-07-13

- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes
- Validation run 2026-07-13; all items pass. The code-vs-state principle
  (factories supply anatomy/worlds; blobs supply state) is an Assumption
  with its rationale, mirroring Doc 06's existing reconstruction rule.
